# WebPageTest jq data scripts
A set of `jq` scripts used to extract useful data from WebPageTest.

I've created this repo off the back of [this blog post](https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2020/10/09/using-jq-with-the-webpagetest-api/) I wrote about extracting certain data from the WebPageTest API using `jq`, which can then be used for other means.
